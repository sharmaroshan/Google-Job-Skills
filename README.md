# Google-Job-Skills

Having an Exploratory Analysis at what kind of Jobs and Job Locations are provided by Google and Youtube, also we look into some specific details which are important to get hired by youtube and google.


# Description

# Context
There is a question in our mind that which language, skills, and experience should we add to our toolbox for getting a job in Google. Well, I think why not we find out the answer by analyzing the Google Jobs Site. Google published all of their jobs at https://careers.google.com/. So I scraped all of the job data from that site by going every job page using Selenium. I only take Job Title, Job Location, Job responsibilities, minimum and preferred qualifications for this dataset.
